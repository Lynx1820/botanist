# The Botanist App
### Getting Started:
This app helps you take care of your houseplants. Sign up for an account and add the various houseplants you want to track! Browse through the informational section for care tips and frequently asked questions about a particular plant species.

Reminders to water your plant are displayed on the main page. Once you've watered the plant, go into the app and mark it as watered, and the app will send you a reminder once it's time to water again.
